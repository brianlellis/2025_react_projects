# Purpose

Apparrently, you're not a real engineer unless you put a bunch of code up for others
to see and judge. As all of my work in my career as has been IP and NDA protected I
generally don't have much of that code.

I also spend an incredible amount of time working on my employer's code. I don't have
much free time to just code for myself and it not be in maintenance hell. So, every
couple years I get a break and push up code to feed whatever Eldritch behemoth is required
to be considered a 'real developer'...

...not that successfully engineering projects over 20+ languages and tech stacks over
the years could prove that.
